# FHIR Ecosystem 

FHIR® – Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (hl7.org/fhir) – is a next generation standards framework created by HL7. FHIR combines the best features of HL7's v2 , HL7 v3  and CDA  product lines while leveraging the latest web standards and applying a tight focus on implementability.

Microsoft's FHIR solutions are built from a set of modular components that can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives. FHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.
